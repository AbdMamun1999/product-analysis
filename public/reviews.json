It tilts backwards very easily and the laptop fell a couple of times.Look for something else for this laptop!","ratings":"4.0","id":3},
    {"image":"./images/images 4.jpg","name":"Noyon Ray","reviews":"The laptop wobbles on the stand, the wobbling was so much that it felt like the laptop to roll over towards the back. The stand isn't even suitable for 14inch laptops. The built quality of the stand is very good though. Purchased the Ventilated stand after this, has been few hours since it arrived, seems much better.","ratings":"3.5","id":4},

Laptop swing on it because of small base. This is being sold on throw away price because this is good for nothing. Just a piece of metal.","ratings":"3.0","id":6}
